## Customer Churn Prediction for Telecom Company

## Overview

This project contains the implementation of diverse classification predictive models for predicting phone service customer churn in a telecommunications business. The implemented models include K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbors), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. The project achieved a notable validation accuracy of 95%.

## Project Components

### 1. Code

The Python code for the implemented predictive models is available in the 'code' repository. The models are designed to predict customer churn based on relevant features in the dataset.

### 2. Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the models is provided in Excel format ('CustomerChurn_Grp4.xlsx'). This dataset underwent thorough data preprocessing to ensure its suitability for predictive modeling.

### 3. Report

A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, analysis, and results of the project is included in the 'report' directory. It covers the rationale behind the model selection, data preprocessing steps, and insights gained from the analysis.


## Summary of Results

Random Forest emerged as the top-performing model, achieving the highest accuracy among the implemented models. In the context of a telecommunications business, not only overall accuracy but also true positive rates are crucial. Random Forest demonstrated a well-balanced trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

From a business perspective, the goal often involves differentiating between types of customers. Regression trees, despite slightly lower overall accuracy, may offer a better solution as they can provide more detailed insights by creating splits that enhance our understanding of different customer segments.
